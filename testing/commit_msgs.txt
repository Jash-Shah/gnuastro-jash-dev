Library (cosmology.c): Added input checks

Until now, there was no internal checking perfomed for the input
parameters (olambda, omatter, oradiation) in the cosmology library
functions.

With this commit, a checking function has been added which ensures
that the fractional densities are between zero and one(inclusive)
and their sum does not exceed one. It throws an error with appropriate
message if either of these constraints are violated.

Also, fixed a typo in the Bootstrapping section in the book where
'README' was spelt as 'REAME'.
